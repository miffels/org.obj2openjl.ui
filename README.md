org.obj2openjl.ui
=================

Basic viewer written for testing for ``org.obj2openjl``. See the other project for a very basic, short description of how to use the library. This project might give you an idea, though, if it is suitable for your application. Below I added a Screenshot of how the application _should_ look like when you clone it and run the Execute class.

These demos are included:

* Stanford Dragon (see below)
* A generator
* A helicopter
* A robot
* A single point (for complex transformations described in ``org.obj2openjl``)
* And, of course, a teapot.

You will need to change the ``Execute`` class and choose the corresponding demo method in order to switch from the default dragon to another model.

*Hint*: Better not touch the slider on the bottom of the toolbar unless you are running the Point demo. It is likely to freeze the VM with the other models.
